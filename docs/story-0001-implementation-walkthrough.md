# Story 0001 - Auth & Org Foundation Implementation Walkthrough

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the implemented authentication and organization foundation system for Story 0001. The implementation is **COMPLETE and ready for UAT testing**.

## System Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Database Models (`backend/app/models/`)

**User Model** (`user.py`):
```python
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(BigInteger, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    org_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("organization.id"), nullable=False)
    email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), nullable=False)
    role: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(32), nullable=False, default="User")
```

**Token Models**:
- `EmailVerificationToken`: Handles email verification flow
- `PasswordResetToken`: Handles password reset flow
- Both include: `user_id`, `token`, `expires_at`, `consumed_at`, `created_at`

**Organization Model** (`organization.py`):
```python
class Organization(Base):
    __tablename__ = "organization"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(BigInteger, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(255), nullable=False)
```

#### 2. Authentication Router (`backend/app/routers/auth.py`)

**Implemented Endpoints**:
- `POST /auth/signup` - User registration with email verification
- `GET /auth/verify` - Email verification with token
- `POST /auth/resend` - Resend verification email with rate limiting
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication with JWT
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile (protected)
- `POST /auth/reset/request` - Request password reset
- `POST /auth/reset/confirm` - Confirm password reset
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout (client-side token clear)

**Key Features**:
- JWT token generation with role claims
- Email verification with secure tokens
- Password reset with token-based flow
- Rate limiting for resend/reset endpoints
- Comprehensive audit logging via `write_auth_event()`
- Role-based access control (SystemAdmin/Admin/User)

#### 3. Security Utilities (`backend/app/utils/security.py`)

**Implemented Functions**:
- `hash_password()` - Bcrypt password hashing
- `verify_password()` - Password verification with legacy support
- `create_jwt_token()` - JWT token creation
- `decode_jwt_token()` - JWT token validation
- `generate_salt()` - Salt generation for legacy passwords

#### 4. API Schemas (`backend/app/schemas/auth.py`)

**Pydantic Models**:
- `SignupRequest`, `LoginRequest`, `ResendRequest`
- `ResetRequest`, `ResetConfirmRequest`
- `LoginResponse`, `MeResponse`

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Authentication Pages (`frontend/src/app/`)

**Implemented Pages**:
- `/login` - User login form
- `/signup` - User registration form
- `/verify` - Email verification page
- `/resend` - Resend verification page
- `/reset/request` - Password reset request
- `/reset/confirm` - Password reset confirmation

#### 2. Authentication Library (`frontend/src/lib/auth.ts`)

**Implemented Functions**:
- `login()`, `signup()`, `verify()`, `resend()`
- `resetRequest()`, `resetConfirm()`, `me()`
- `setToken()`, `getToken()`, `clearToken()`
- JWT token management with localStorage

#### 3. Protected Routes

**Dashboard** (`/`):
- Automatically redirects to login if not authenticated
- Displays user profile information
- Shows role-based content

**Builder** (`/builder/[eventId]`):
- Protected route requiring authentication
- Dynamic import for performance

## Authentication Flow

### 1. User Registration Flow
1. User submits signup form
2. Backend creates user record (unverified)
3. Verification token generated and emailed
4. User receives email with verification link
5. User clicks link to verify email
6. Account becomes verified and ready for login

### 2. User Login Flow
1. User submits login credentials
2. Backend validates email/password
3. Checks if email is verified
4. Generates JWT token with role claims
5. Frontend stores token in localStorage
6. User redirected to dashboard

### 3. Password Reset Flow
1. User requests password reset
2. Backend generates reset token and emails
3. User clicks reset link in email
4. User submits new password
5. Backend validates token and updates password
6. User can login with new password

## Security Features

### 1. Token Security
- Verification/reset tokens: 32+ byte random tokens
- JWT tokens with expiration (8 hours)
- One-time use tokens (consumed after use)
- Secure token storage in database

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Resend verification: 60-second cooldown, 5 per day max
- Password reset: Similar rate limiting
- Audit logging for all attempts

### 3. Password Security
- Bcrypt hashing for new passwords
- Legacy SHA256 support for existing passwords
- Secure password verification

### 4. Audit Logging
- All auth events logged to `AuthEvent` table
- Includes: user_id, email, event_type, status, reason_code
- IP address and User-Agent tracking
- Request ID correlation

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables (`.env.dev`):
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=mssql+pyodbc://sa:YourStrong!Passw0rd@localhost:1433/master?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=replace_me  # ⚠️ Should be changed for production

# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=localhost
SMTP_PORT=1025
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_FROM=dev@example.com

# CORS
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

## UX Feedback and Refinements (2025-09-19)

Based on initial testing and a review by the UX expert, the following refinements have been identified and implemented to improve the user experience.

### 1. Verification Link Clarity (High Priority)

*   **Observation:** The original flow could lead to confusing "Token expired" or "Invalid Token" errors, particularly when a user double-clicks the verification link or the browser auto-refreshes the page. This erodes trust and can cause user frustration right after signing up.
*   **Implementation:** The `/auth/verify` endpoint has been updated with the following logic:
    *   If a consumed token is used again within a very short timeframe (< 2 seconds), it is treated as a harmless double-click. The user is redirected to the login page with a success message (`?verified=true`).
    *   If a consumed token is used after this grace period, it's a potential reuse attempt. The user is redirected to the login page with a clear, actionable error message (`?error=This verification link has already been used. Please try logging in.`).
    *   Similarly, for genuinely expired or invalid links, the user is redirected with a clear error message in the URL.

### 2. Login Page Context

*   **Observation:** The login page is a single destination for multiple paths (direct navigation, post-verification, post-logout, failed actions). It currently lacks context for the user.
*   **Recommendation:** Use query parameters in the URL to provide contextual messages on the login page. The changes to the `/verify` endpoint are a perfect example of this. This pattern should be applied consistently. The frontend team will need to build a component to display these messages clearly to the user.

### 3. Password Reset Flow

*   **Observation:** The password reset confirmation is a simple API response ("status: updated"). This leaves the user on a static page without a clear next step.
*   **Recommendation:** After a successful password reset, the user should be automatically redirected to the login page with a clear success message (e.g., "Your password has been updated. Please log in with your new password."). This provides a smoother transition back into the application.

## v2 Acceptance Criteria Updates (2025-09-20)

Scope: Org-scoped authentication, invitations, and Domain Claims alignment per PRD v2/Architecture v2.

- Org-scoped auth: memberships tracked as `(org_id, user_id)` with roles `Admin`/`User`; JWT carries org context; protected routes enforce org role.
- DomainClaims (email-based): DMARC-aligned verification; statuses `pending|verified|revoked|pending_conflict`; wildcard allowed only post root verify with Owner + 2FA; `proof` stores hashed headers; no member identity leakage.
- Invitations: enforce `UNIQUE(org_id, lower(email)) WHERE consumed_at IS NULL`; TTL from `GlobalSetting.invite_token_ttl_hours`; daily cap from `GlobalSetting.invite_daily_limit`; 429 on cap with `Retry-After` header; accept consumes token and creates membership in target org.
- Privacy-safe join: when email domain matches a verified org domain, show CTA to Request to Join; never reveal member names or member counts.
- Audit: issuance/consumption of invite tokens, domain claim lifecycle changes, and role changes are audited with actor and before/after JSON.
- Telemetry: `domain_verify_attempt`, `domain_verify_success` emitted on flows; `invite_create`, `invite_accept` events logged (names illustrative).
