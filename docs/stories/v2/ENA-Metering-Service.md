## Description
Implement idempotent metering ingest with durable queue and replay; Pricing Engine and Estimator using shared rules; budgets/caps enforcement at adapters and engine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/metering/events` accepts batches; enqueues with idempotency on `request_id`; duplicate yields 409 or safe no-op.
2. Nightly reconciliation compares provider logs to `metering_event`/`ledger`; emits deltas and alerts.
3. Estimator parity harness validates pricing vs engine across 10â€‘SKU matrix.
4. Budgets/caps enforced both at action initiation (email/SMS) and during pricing evaluation; admin override path exists.
