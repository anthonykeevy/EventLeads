## Description
Implement consumption pricing engine that computes charges from metering events, supports tiered pricing, currency rounding, and tax codes, and writes ledger lines. Provide parity with Estimator and nightly/on-demand pricing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Engine computes charges per event and rollup; supports tier ladders from `plan_sku.tiers`.
2. Currency rounding rules and tax codes applied; results deterministic and replay-safe.
3. Nightly batch pricing and on-demand pricing endpoints produce identical results for the same inputs.
4. Parity with Estimator validated via golden 10â€‘SKU matrix; deviations flagged.
5. Idempotency: repeated pricing requests with same `request_id` do not duplicate ledger lines.
